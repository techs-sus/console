# todo list

- add client command bar, gui like in rnix (almost)
- make the server replicate gui instances to the client for speedy and undeletable guis
- add an error handler (this is filled by the Exit type, but it currently uses `coroutine.yield` to exit)
- maybe add autocomplete, if it doesnt break textboxes, also since we this type safe system, it should be very easy
